# Problem Statement
AtliQ Mart is a rapidly expanding FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. With current operations in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, the company has ambitious plans to scale its presence to other Tier-1 and metropolitan cities over the next two years.

However, AtliQ Mart is currently facing a critical challenge: several key customers have opted not to renew their annual contracts, citing service-related concerns. Preliminary investigations suggest that recurring issues with product deliveries‚Äîeither arriving late or not being delivered in full‚Äîmay have compromised customer satisfaction and trust.

In response, the management team is prioritizing service quality improvements before pursuing further expansion. To proactively address these concerns, they have commissioned the Supply Chain Analytics Team to closely monitor and evaluate the company‚Äôs delivery performance.

The team has adopted a standardized methodology to track and measure delivery service levels on a daily basis. This includes:

### On-Time Delivery Percentage (OT%)

### In-Full Delivery Percentage (IF%)

### On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)

These KPIs will be monitored against predefined target levels for each customer. By leveraging these metrics, the company aims to identify service gaps in real-time, enable faster operational responses, and rebuild confidence among its customer base.

This initiative not only supports immediate service recovery efforts but also lays the groundwork for a more reliable and scalable supply chain‚Äîcritical for AtliQ Mart‚Äôs long-term growth and successful market expansion.
## üìä Overview
This Power BI visualization examines the on-time delivery performance (On Time %) of a company across various months and compares it to a fixed performance target (On Time Target), which is set at 86.09% for all months.

## üìÖ Key Insights by Month:

Month	On Time %	Target Met?
March	59.57%	  -‚ùå No
April	59.32%	  -‚ùå No
May	58.50%	    -‚ùå No
June	58.51%	  -‚ùå No
July	59.39%	  -‚ùå No
August	58.88%  -‚ùå No
Despite fluctuations, performance has consistently stayed below target, with an average on-time rate around 58-59%, significantly below the 86% benchmark.

Overall OTIF performance: Only 29.02% of deliveries met both "On Time" and "In Full" criteria ‚Äî significantly below the 65.91% target.

OT Performance: Averaged 59.03%, with a shortfall of 27.05% from the target (86.09%).

IF Performance: Averaged 52.78%, missing the target (76.51%) by 23.73%.

LIFR and VOFR: LIFR stands at 66.0%, while VOFR remains strong at 96.6%.

City-wise OTIF:

Surat: 30.07%

Ahmedabad: 29.33%

Product-level LIFR: Most key products are below 68% LIFR.

Average Delay: Deliveries were delayed by an average of 1.69 days.

Total Late Orders: Over 16,491 orders were delayed.

## üìå Recommendations:
Root Cause Analysis: Conduct a detailed investigation into delays ‚Äî consider areas like warehousing, transportation, vendor issues, and order processing times.

Set Interim Targets: To build momentum, consider monthly improvement milestones instead of only one fixed high target.

Performance Tracking Dashboards: Enhance visibility and accountability by sharing dashboards across teams.

Predictive Analytics: Leverage machine learning models to forecast potential delays and optimize routes or resource planning.

## üí° Final Thoughts
This dashboard serves as a critical performance alert. In high-stakes industries, 86% on-time delivery is not just a goal ‚Äî it's a promise. Missing it consistently is a signal that needs immediate attention.
